## Subdecks2tags

[Too many subdecks will slow down Anki](https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#using-decks-appropriately).
This tool adds tags to every note in a deck based on the subdeck(s) that their cards belong to. This preserves a deck's hierarchy and allows anki subdecks to be removed.
It was created to automate the process of reformatting legacy Anki decks towards the use of tags.
